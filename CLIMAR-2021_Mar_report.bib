abstract = {This document places the use of climate projections in the context of risk analysis and aims to help you navigate the different components of the UKCP18 land projection with examples of how you can use them. It covers: 1. Using climate model projections 2. Why are there multiple strands of information? 3. What should you be aware of before using the land projections? 4. What is the relationship between the sets of land projections? 5. How do you choose the appropriate UKCP18 projections? 5.1 When should you use the probabilistic projections? 5.2 When should you use the global (60km) projections? 5.3 When should you use the regional (12km) and local (2.2km) projections? 5.4 When should you use the derived projections? 6. How do the UKCP18 land projections relate to UKCP09? 7. How do you access the data and get further information? 1. Using climate model projections • Together with observations, projections can be used as one source of information when planning for the future or as a communication tool. • When planning for the future, you may wish to carry out a climate change risk assessment. This needs to takes into account the hazard, exposure, vulnerability and how they interact with each other (see Figure 1). Climate model projections and observations only inform one aspect of this interaction, i.e. the climate component of the hazard. • Your approach to climate change risk assessment and how it informs decision-making informs whether, how and which climate model projections that you use. • This document assumes that you have already established your approach and wish to better understand the information that the UKCP18 land projections could potentially offer to inform the climate-related hazard.},

abstract = {The thermal sensation experienced by a subject in a confined environment is significantly affected by the radiative heat exchange between the human body and the surrounding surfaces: it contributes as far as 30{\%} of the whole thermal exchanges of the subject. Besides, the presence of high-intensity radiation sources like, for example, the sun, may appreciably modify the radiant field to which people are exposed. As a consequence, this could alter notably the comfort conditions. In order of properly taking into account this issue, a simple analytical method is introduced in this work, that allows the easy evaluation of the thermal radiant field induced by the presence of the solar radiation. An application to a typical thermal comfort computation is finally presented. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Military and civil defense personnel are often involved in complex activities in a variety of outdoor environments. The choice of appropriate clothing ensembles represents an important strategy to establish the success of a military mission. The main aim of this study was to compare the known clothing insulation of the garment ensembles worn by soldiers during two winter outdoor field trials (hike and guard duty) with the estimated optimal clothing thermal insulations recommended to maintain thermoneutrality, assessed by using two different biometeorological procedures. The overall aim was to assess the applicability of such biometeorological procedures to weather forecast systems, thereby developing a comprehensive biometeorological tool for military operational forecast purposes. Military trials were carried out during winter 2006 in Pokljuka (Slovenia) by Slovene Armed Forces personnel. Gastrointestinal temperature, heart rate and environmental parameters were measured with portable data acquisition systems. The thermal characteristics of the clothing ensembles worn by the soldiers, namely thermal resistance, were determined with a sweating thermal manikin. Results showed that the clothing ensemble worn by the military was appropriate during guard duty but generally inappropriate during the hike. A general under-estimation of the biometeorological forecast model in predicting the optimal clothing insulation value was observed and an additional post-processing calibration might further improve forecast accuracy. This study represents the first step in the development of a comprehensive personalized biometeorological forecast system aimed at improving recommendations regarding the optimal thermal insulation of military garment ensembles for winter activities.},

Particularly, we discussed how the precursor composition, dealloying conditions, and post treatment would affect the nanoporous structure; and how to control the nanoporous structures (such as hierarchical nanoporous structures) based on these understanding. We also provided some characterizations, size-dependent properties, and outlook on future research in this fascinating area.},

@article{Blazejczyk2012,
abstract = {Over the past century more than 100 indices have been developed and used to assess bioclimatic conditions for human beings. The majority of these indices are used sporadically or for specific purposes. Some are based on generalized results of measurements (wind chill, cooling power, wet bulb temperature) and some on the empirically observed reactions of the human body to thermal stress (physiological strain, effective temperature). Those indices that are based on human heat balance considerations are referred to as "rational indices". Several simple human heat balance models are known and are used in research and practice. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the newly developed Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), and some of the more prevalent thermal indices. The analysis is based on three groups of data: global data-set, synoptic datasets from Europe, and local scale data from special measurement campaigns of COST Action 730. We found the present indices to express bioclimatic conditions reasonably only under specific meteorological situations, while the UTCI represents specific climates, weather, and locations much better. Furthermore, similar to the human body, the UTCI is very sensitive to changes in ambient stimuli: temperature, solar radiation, wind and humidity. UTCI depicts temporal variability of thermal conditions better than other indices. The UTCI scale is able to express even slight differences in the intensity of meteorological stimuli. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Heat stress negatively influences human health and performance, and leading to lower efficiency in daily activities. The present study sought to examine the relationship between UTCI, other heat indices (SET, PET, PMV, PPD, and WBGT), and environmental parameters. Daily data, encompassing a 12 month period in 2016 (from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. for each day), were retrieved from the Meteorological Organization of Kerman. The data were fed into SPSS 20, followed by conducting Pearson product moment correlation and linear regression to find the association between UTCI and other heat indices/environmental parameters. Excel 2016 was also utilized to draw the relevant diagrams. Significant correlations were detected between UTCI and other heat indices (SET, PET, PMV, and WBGT). UTCI also was measurably correlated with environmental parameters like dry temperature (P {\textless} 0.0001). The highest correlation coefficient was observed between UTCI and PET (r = 0.96). UTCI also had strong correlations with WBGT (r = 0.88), SET (r = 0.87), and dry temperature (r = 0.90). Thus, indices that are calculated based on body thermal equation (i.e. SET and PET) are more strongly connected with UTCI, registering a better slope. On the other hand, WBGT is more similar to UTCI (than other indices) in terms of thermal perception.},

abstract = {Two extreme heatwaves hit Western Europe in the summer of 2019, with historical records broken by more than a degree in many locations, and significant societal impacts, including excess mortality of several thousand people. The extent to which human influence has played a role in the occurrence of these events has been of large interest to scientists, media and decision makers. However, the outstanding nature of these events poses challenges for physical and statistical modeling. Using an unprecedented number of climate model ensembles and statistical extreme value modeling, we demonstrate that these short and intense events would have had extremely small odds in the absence of human-induced climate change, and equivalently frequent events would have been 1.5 °C to 3 °C colder. For instance, in France and in The Netherlands, the July 3-day heatwave has a 50-150-year return period in the current climate and a return period of more than 1000 years without human forcing. The increase in the intensities is larger than the global warming by a factor 2 to 3. Finally, we note that the observed trends are much larger than those in current climate models.},

@article{Weihs2018,
abstract = {In the present study, we investigate the determination accuracy of the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI). We study especially the UTCI uncertainties due to uncertainties in radiation fluxes, whose impacts on UTCI are evaluated via the mean radiant temperature (Tmrt). We assume "normal condi-tions", which means that usual meteorological information and data are available but no special additional measurements. First, the uncertainty arising only from the measurement uncertainties of the meteorological data is determined. Here, simulations show that uncertainties between 0.4 and 2 K due to the uncertainty of just one of the meteorological input parameters may be expected. We then analyse the determination accuracy when not all radiation data are available and modelling of the missing data is required. Since radiative transfer models require a lot of information that is usually not available, we concentrate only on the determination accuracy achievable with empirical models. The simulations show that uncertainties in the calculation of the diffuse irradiance may lead to Tmrt uncertainties of up to ±2.9 K. If long-wave radiation is missing, we may expect an uncertainty of ±2 K. If modelling of diffuse radiation and of longwave radiation is used for the calculation of Tmrt, we may then expect a determination uncertainty of ±3 K. If all radiative fluxes are modelled based on synoptic observation, the uncertainty in Tmrt is ±5.9 K. Because Tmrt is only one of the four input data required in the calculation of UTCI, the uncertainty in UTCI due to the uncertainty in radiation fluxes is less than ±2 K. The UTCI uncertainties due to uncertainties of the four meteorological input values are not larger than the 6 K reference intervals of the UTCI scale, which means that UTCI may only be wrong by one UTCI scale. This uncertainty may, however, be critical at the two temperature extremes, i.e. under extreme hot or extreme cold conditions.},

abstract = {Background The burden of heat illness on health systems is not well described in the UK. Although the UK generally experiences mild summers, the frequency and intensity of hot weather is likely to increase due to climate change, particularly in Southern England. We investigated the impact of the moderate heatwave in 2013 on primary care and emergency department (ED) visits using syndromic surveillance data in England.Methods General practitioner in hours (GPIH), GP out of hours (GPOOH) and ED syndromic surveillance systems were used to monitor the health impact of heat/sun stroke symptoms (heat illness). Data were stratified by age group and compared between heatwave and non-heatwave years. Incidence rate ratios were calculated for GPIH heat illness consultations.Results GP consultations and ED attendances for heat illness increased during the heatwave period; GPIH consultations increased across all age groups, but the highest rates were in school children and those aged ≥75 years, with the latter persisting beyond the end of the heatwave. Extrapolating to the English population, we estimated that the number of GPIH consultations for heat illness during the whole summer (May to September) 2013 was 1166 (95{\%} CI 1064 to 1268). This was double the rate observed during non-heatwave years.Conclusions These findings support the monitoring of heat illness (symptoms of heat/sun stroke) as part of the Heatwave Plan for England, but also suggest that specifically monitoring heat illness in children, especially those of school age, would provide additional early warning of, and situation awareness during heatwaves.},

abstract = {The mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) is one of the most important meteorological parameters governing human energy balance. In this paper, three different methods of obtaining the Tmrt in an outdoor urban setting are compared. Method A is based on integral radiation measurements and angular factors, method B is based on measurements with a 38-mm. flat grey globe thermometer and in method C makes use of the Rayman 1.2 software is used. Measurements were performed in a large open square in a high latitude city - G{\"{o}}teborg, Sweden - during clear to overcast weather conditions in October 2005 and in July and August 2006. Results show that the difference between Method A and Method B was generally relatively small. Most of the discrepancy, caused by rapid changes in radiation, temperature and wind speed was smoothed out using 5 min mean values. By systematically and empirically changing the mean convection coefficient, the accuracy of Method B was improved and a new equation expressing the Tmrt was obtained. With this new equation the 38 mm flat grey globe thermometer could successfully be used to estimate the Tmrt in an outdoor urban setting provided that the wind speed and the air and globe temperatures are measured accurately. The study also shows that the flat grey colour of the globe thermometer slightly underestimates the level of short-wave radiation (i.e. sunshine). Method C works very well during the middle of the day in July, i.e. at high sun elevations. However, the model considerably underestimates the Tmrt in the morning and evening in July and during the whole day in October, i.e. at low sun elevations. In outdoor urban settings where thermal comfort researchers or urban planners and designers require an easy and reliable method of estimating mean radiant temperature, the 38 mm flat grey globe thermometer provides a good and cheap solution.

abstract = {In this work, the potential of the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) as a heat-related health risk indicator in Europe is demonstrated. The UTCI is a bioclimate index that uses a multi-node human heat balance model to represent the heat stress induced by meteorological conditions to the human body. Using 38 years of meteorological reanalysis data, UTCI maps were computed to assess the thermal bioclimate of Europe for the summer season. Patterns of heat stress conditions and non-thermal stress regions are identified across Europe. An increase in heat stress up to 1 °C is observed during recent decades. Correlation with mortality data from 17 European countries revealed that the relationship between the UTCI and death counts depends on the bioclimate of the country, and death counts increase in conditions of moderate and strong stress, i.e., when UTCI is above 26 and 32 °C. The UTCI's ability to represent mortality patterns is demonstrated for the 2003 European heatwave. These findings confirm the importance of UTCI as a bioclimatic index that is able to both capture the thermal bioclimatic variability of Europe, and relate such variability with the effects it has on human health.},

abstract = {The summer of 2003 was probably the hottest in Europe since at latest ad 15001,2,3,4, and unusually large numbers of heat-related deaths were reported in France, Germany and Italy5. It is an ill-posed question whether the 2003 heatwave was caused, in a simple deterministic sense, by a modification of the external influences on climate—for example, increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere—because almost any such weather event might have occurred by chance in an unmodified climate. However, it is possible to estimate by how much human activities may have increased the risk of the occurrence of such a heatwave6,7,8. Here we use this conceptual framework to estimate the contribution of human-induced increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and other pollutants to the risk of the occurrence of unusually high mean summer temperatures throughout a large region of continental Europe. Using a threshold for mean summer temperature that was exceeded in 2003, but in no other year since the start of the instrumental record in 1851, we estimate it is very likely (confidence level {\textgreater}90{\%})9 that human influence has at least doubled the risk of a heatwave exceeding this threshold magnitude.},

abstract = {The assessment of the thermal environment is one of the main issues in bioclimatic research, and more than 100 simple bioclimatic indices have thus far been developed to facilitate it. However, most of these indices have proved to be of limited applicability, and do not portray the actual impacts of thermal conditions on human beings. Indices derived from human heatbalance models (one- or two-node) have been found to offer a better representation of the environmental impact in question than do simple ones. Indeed, the new generation of multi-node models for human heat balance do allow full account to be taken of heat transfer and exchange, both within the human body and between the body surface and the surrounding air layer. In this paper, it is essential background information regarding the newly-developed Universal Thermal Climate Index UTCI that is presented, this in fact deriving from the Fiala multi-node model of human heatbalance. The UTCI is defined as the air temperature (Ta) of the reference condition causing the same model response as actual conditions. UTCI was developed in 2009 by virtue of international co-operation between leading experts in the areas of human thermophysiology, physiological modelling, meteorology and climatology. The necessary research for this had been conducted within the framework of a special commission of the International Society of Biometeorology (ISB) and European COST Action 730. {\textcopyright} Geographia Polonica.},
