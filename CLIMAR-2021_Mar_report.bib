abstract = {The thermal sensation experienced by a subject in a confined environment is significantly affected by the radiative heat exchange between the human body and the surrounding surfaces: it contributes as far as 30{\%} of the whole thermal exchanges of the subject. Besides, the presence of high-intensity radiation sources like, for example, the sun, may appreciably modify the radiant field to which people are exposed. As a consequence, this could alter notably the comfort conditions. In order of properly taking into account this issue, a simple analytical method is introduced in this work, that allows the easy evaluation of the thermal radiant field induced by the presence of the solar radiation. An application to a typical thermal comfort computation is finally presented. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Blazejczyk2012,
abstract = {Over the past century more than 100 indices have been developed and used to assess bioclimatic conditions for human beings. The majority of these indices are used sporadically or for specific purposes. Some are based on generalized results of measurements (wind chill, cooling power, wet bulb temperature) and some on the empirically observed reactions of the human body to thermal stress (physiological strain, effective temperature). Those indices that are based on human heat balance considerations are referred to as "rational indices". Several simple human heat balance models are known and are used in research and practice. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the newly developed Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), and some of the more prevalent thermal indices. The analysis is based on three groups of data: global data-set, synoptic datasets from Europe, and local scale data from special measurement campaigns of COST Action 730. We found the present indices to express bioclimatic conditions reasonably only under specific meteorological situations, while the UTCI represents specific climates, weather, and locations much better. Furthermore, similar to the human body, the UTCI is very sensitive to changes in ambient stimuli: temperature, solar radiation, wind and humidity. UTCI depicts temporal variability of thermal conditions better than other indices. The UTCI scale is able to express even slight differences in the intensity of meteorological stimuli. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author(s).},

@article{Thorsson2007,
abstract = {The mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) is one of the most important meteorological parameters governing human energy balance. In this paper, three different methods of obtaining the Tmrt in an outdoor urban setting are compared. Method A is based on integral radiation measurements and angular factors, method B is based on measurements with a 38-mm. flat grey globe thermometer and in method C makes use of the Rayman 1.2 software is used. Measurements were performed in a large open square in a high latitude city - G{\"{o}}teborg, Sweden - during clear to overcast weather conditions in October 2005 and in July and August 2006. Results show that the difference between Method A and Method B was generally relatively small. Most of the discrepancy, caused by rapid changes in radiation, temperature and wind speed was smoothed out using 5 min mean values. By systematically and empirically changing the mean convection coefficient, the accuracy of Method B was improved and a new equation expressing the Tmrt was obtained. With this new equation the 38 mm flat grey globe thermometer could successfully be used to estimate the Tmrt in an outdoor urban setting provided that the wind speed and the air and globe temperatures are measured accurately. The study also shows that the flat grey colour of the globe thermometer slightly underestimates the level of short-wave radiation (i.e. sunshine). Method C works very well during the middle of the day in July, i.e. at high sun elevations. However, the model considerably underestimates the Tmrt in the morning and evening in July and during the whole day in October, i.e. at low sun elevations. In outdoor urban settings where thermal comfort researchers or urban planners and designers require an easy and reliable method of estimating mean radiant temperature, the 38 mm flat grey globe thermometer provides a good and cheap solution.

@article{Vautard2020,
abstract = {Two extreme heatwaves hit Western Europe in the summer of 2019, with historical records broken by more than a degree in many locations, and significant societal impacts, including excess mortality of several thousand people. The extent to which human influence has played a role in the occurrence of these events has been of large interest to scientists, media and decision makers. However, the outstanding nature of these events poses challenges for physical and statistical modeling. Using an unprecedented number of climate model ensembles and statistical extreme value modeling, we demonstrate that these short and intense events would have had extremely small odds in the absence of human-induced climate change, and equivalently frequent events would have been 1.5 °C to 3 °C colder. For instance, in France and in The Netherlands, the July 3-day heatwave has a 50-150-year return period in the current climate and a return period of more than 1000 years without human forcing. The increase in the intensities is larger than the global warming by a factor 2 to 3. Finally, we note that the observed trends are much larger than those in current climate models.},

abstract = {The assessment of the thermal environment is one of the main issues in bioclimatic research, and more than 100 simple bioclimatic indices have thus far been developed to facilitate it. However, most of these indices have proved to be of limited applicability, and do not portray the actual impacts of thermal conditions on human beings. Indices derived from human heatbalance models (one- or two-node) have been found to offer a better representation of the environmental impact in question than do simple ones. Indeed, the new generation of multi-node models for human heat balance do allow full account to be taken of heat transfer and exchange, both within the human body and between the body surface and the surrounding air layer. In this paper, it is essential background information regarding the newly-developed Universal Thermal Climate Index UTCI that is presented, this in fact deriving from the Fiala multi-node model of human heatbalance. The UTCI is defined as the air temperature (Ta) of the reference condition causing the same model response as actual conditions. UTCI was developed in 2009 by virtue of international co-operation between leading experts in the areas of human thermophysiology, physiological modelling, meteorology and climatology. The necessary research for this had been conducted within the framework of a special commission of the International Society of Biometeorology (ISB) and European COST Action 730. {\textcopyright} Geographia Polonica.},
