% ABSTRACT (below 300 words)
\section*{Abstract}
CLIMAR! Mention Climar framework!
As global average temperatures continue to increase under climate change, extreme events will become commonplace and previously impossible events the new extremes. The impacts of high temperatures  are far reaching and the increased likelihood of extreme heatwaves is already being felt, for instance with the 2003(??) European heatwave which caused **** excess deaths [cit]. In the UK the Met Office define a heatwave as three or more consecutive days of daily maximum temperatures exceeding a given threshold temperature, as defined by the local climatology[cit]. We use this to analyse the number and duration of heatwaves projected to occur in London under the UKCP18 climate projections. In addition we conduct this heatwave analysis using a Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) adjustment to the maximum daily air temperature, which factors in humidity and windspeed to provide a more physiologically accurate representation of high temperatures. This could be used to overcome some of the assumptions posed in the Met Office heatwave definition in order to define a more universal heatwave definition.

% INTRODUCTION
\section*{Introduction}

Background:
- CLIMAR/Risk framework...
- Climate change global temperature increase
- European heatwave 2003(?)
- UK heatwaves 2020
- Excess deaths, infrastructure impacts, etc.
- Met Office heatwave definition [\cite{McCarthy2019}]
    - Important to challenge assumptions since dominant weather patterns may change in future 
- UTCI background

\section*{Results}



Plots
- Decadal box plots
- Poisson fits
- Report poisson lambdas

Results:
- Compare tasmax, utci and utci10
- 

\section*{Discussion}

Implications:
- UTCI with met office threshold not good
- UTCI does pick out heatwaves, but less than plain air temperature

Ways to improve:
- Tmrt excluded from UTCI calculation because not enough data to calculate it
    - Assumed Ta=Tmrt, but this is a substantial assumption i.e. air in thermal equilibrium with surroundings
    - Will exclude urban heat island effects, which are substantial [cit]
    - To what extent is urban heat island already accounted for in UKCP air temperature data?
    - Tmrt can't be applied to UTCI retroactively (e.g. once Exposure has been calculated) since UTCI relies on a 6th order polynomial calculation including every iteration of using Tmrt
- Humidity and windspeed used in UTCI calculation are daily means so not at same time of day as tasmax
    - However they don't affect the temperature strongly, so source of error is minimal
    - Tmrt is source of bigger error since effect is larger
    - Covariance matrices?


Future exploration:
- Explore change in higher tiers of heat stress from UTCI data
- Tasmin (nighttime) temperatures
- Use incident radiation and cloud cover to improve UTCI calculation
- Use urban data to better model mean radiant temperature
- Use zero-inflated Poisson to fit heatwave duration graphs

    An accelerated increase is observed in the later decades of the 21\textsuperscript{st} century.
    Here hot days are defined as the total number of days in the year that exceed a threshold, whereas heatwave days are the total number of days in the year that are part of a continuous 3+ day heatwave. This analysis was done with raw and UTCI adjusted maximum daily air temperatures using thresholds defined by the Met Office and UTCI heat stress theory. Air temperature values for Greater London area used.
