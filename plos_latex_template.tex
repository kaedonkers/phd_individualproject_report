% ABSTRACT (below 300 words)
\section*{Abstract}
% CLIMAR! Mention Climar framework!
As global average temperatures continue to increase under climate change, extreme events will become commonplace and previously impossible events the new extremes. The impacts of high temperatures  are far reaching and the increased likelihood of extreme heatwaves is already being felt, for instance with the 2003(??) European heatwave which caused **** excess deaths [cit]. In the UK the Met Office define a heatwave as three or more consecutive days of daily maximum temperatures exceeding a given threshold temperature, as defined by the local climatology[cit]. We use this to analyse the number and duration of heatwaves projected to occur in London under the UKCP18 climate projections. In addition we conduct this heatwave analysis using a Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) adjustment to the maximum daily air temperature, which factors in humidity and windspeed to provide a more physiologically accurate representation of high temperatures. This could be used to overcome some of the assumptions posed in the Met Office heatwave definition in order to define a more universal heatwave definition.

% INTRODUCTION
\section*{Introduction}

% Background:
% - CLIMAR/Risk framework...

% - Climate change global temperature increase
% - European heatwave 2003 [cit Stott2004] = hottest european summer for 500 years
% - European heatwave 2019 [cit Voutard2020] = record breaking
% - UK heatwave mortality [cit johnson2005] and morbidity [cit smith2016]
% - infrastructure impacts [cit Dawson et al., 2017]

As global mean temperatures increase due to climate change, heatwaves are expected to get hotter, longer and more frequent. 
Indeed we are already seeing many more unprecedented heatwaves in Europe, starting in 2003 with the hottest heatwave for 500 years\cite{Stott2004} and continuing to break records in 2019, the latter being statistically attributed to anthropogenic climate change.\cite{Vautard2020} 
The UK heatwave in August 2020 was another record breaker.\cite{Askew2020}
Heatwaves in the UK have been shown to increase human morbidity\cite{Smith2016}, mortality\cite{Johnson2004} and disruption to critical infrastructure.\cite{Dawson2016}

MET OFFICE UKCP CLIMATE PROJECTIONS

The World Meteorological Organisation defines a heatwave as\cite{WMO2018}:
\begin{quote}
    A period of marked unusual hot weather over a region persisting for at least three consecutive days during the warm period of the year based on local climatological conditions, with thermal conditions recorded above given thresholds.
\end{quote}
The UK Met Office uses this definition to specify a heatwave as three or more consecutive days where the maximum daily air temperature exceeds a threshold defined by the local climatology, as published by McCarthy \textit{et al.}.\cite{McCarthy2019}
In this case the threshold is the 90{\textsuperscript{th}} percentile of maximum daily temperature for July in years 1981-2010 within a county, rounded to nearest whole °C.
This definition was chosen for both its correlation with public perception that a heatwave must be perceived as an uncommon event and the need for national meteorological services to issue warnings infrequently enough so as not to lose their efficacy.
To these ends, the definition achieves its aims.
However, a number of critiques can be raised about this definition.

First, the baseline period that this definition uses is well within living memory but also includes a number of the ten hottest years on record.\cite{McCarthy2019}
This is good in terms of public perception but bad for comparing heatwave events decades in the future as heatwave events are expected to increase in frequency and the future public is likely to perceive a different baseline.

Second, McCarthy \textit{et al.} define the threshold on a county by county basis, which is convenient for public communication but not universal or applicable to all areas of a county.
For instance, many coastal counties in England experience the full range of 90\textsuperscript{th} percentile July maximum daily temperatures used to define the threshold, as seen in Fig ~\ref{McCarthy-fig3}.\cite{McCarthy2019}
Similarly, urban areas which experience greater overall temperatures than the surrounding rural areas of the same county due to urban heat island effects, yet thresholds are defined based on an area average.

Third, air temperature may be a good indicator of how hot conditions feel, but physiologically accurate estimates of heat stress rely on multiple meteorological factors, such as humidity and wind speed, and non-meteorological factors, such as ambient temperature and availability of shading.
Basing a heatwave definition on maximum daily temperature alone is simple and broadly representative of the meteorological conditions that tend to accompany heat waves the UK (summer high-pressure systems), but these conditions may not hold in future as the UK's climate heats up and unprecedented weather patterns emerge.

\begin{figure}

    }
    \label{McCarthy-fig3}
% \end{adjustwidth}
\end{figure}

Therefore, an alternative to basing heatwave definitions on maximum daily air temperature and a local threshold would be base them on biometeorological heat stress metrics which factor in human physiological responses to high temperatures.
This would allow heatwaves to be defined in terms of their effects on people rather than a perceived unusuality of events.
Over 100 such metrics have been defined in the literature, but Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) was found to be most suitable at representing human response to thermal stress under a variety of climatic and meteorological conditions.\cite{Blazejczyk2012, DiNapoli2018, Zare2018}



- Therefore a comparison of Met Office heatwave thresholds with UTCI heat stress thresholds is conducted in this paper.

% - WMO heatwave definition [cit WMO2018]
%     - "A period of marked unusual hot weather
% over a region persisting for at least three consecutive days during the warm period of the year based on local climatological con- ditions, with thermal conditions recorded above given thresholds." 

% - Met Office heatwave definition [\cite{McCarthy2019}]
%     - Important to challenge assumptions since dominant weather patterns may change in future 
%     - "Despite the widespread usage, ... there is no unified definition, either within the United Kingdom or internationally." [\cite{McCarthy2019}]
    
%     - 90th percentile of maximum daily temperature for July in years 1981-2010 within a county, rounded to nearest whole degree °C.

%     - Critique of this method
%         - Definition relies on climatology, but years in which climate change have already adjusted climatology were used. It is not clear for which years this shifting baseline is relevant.
%         - Climatology includes some of the ten warmest years on record (since 2002)
%         - Climatology includes 
%         - Climatology arbitrarily defined on a county basis, despite marked variation within some county boundaries.
%         - Definition has been made to balance responsibilities of national meteorological service messaging, in which public perception and frequency of messaging are key consideration.
%         - However this is not so useful when applied to climate projection data decades in the future.
%         - Physiologically significant physical parameters like humidity and wind speed not included

\section*{Discussion}

Implications:
- UTCI with met office threshold not good
- UTCI does pick out heatwaves, but less than plain air temperature

Ways to improve:
- Tmrt excluded from UTCI calculation because not enough data to calculate it
    - Assumed Ta=Tmrt, but this is a substantial assumption i.e. air in thermal equilibrium with surroundings
    - Will exclude urban heat island effects, which are substantial [cit]
    - To what extent is urban heat island already accounted for in UKCP air temperature data?
    - Tmrt can't be applied to UTCI retroactively (e.g. once Exposure has been calculated) since UTCI relies on a 6th order polynomial calculation including every iteration of using Tmrt
    - \cite{Weihs2018}
- Humidity and windspeed used in UTCI calculation are daily means so not at same time of day as tasmax
    - However they don't affect the temperature strongly, so source of error is minimal
    - Tmrt is source of bigger error since effect is larger
    - Covariance matrices?
- 

Future exploration:
- Explore change in higher tiers of heat stress from UTCI data
- Tasmin (nighttime) temperatures ("tropical nights")
- Use incident radiation and cloud cover to improve UTCI calculation
- Use urban data to better model mean radiant temperature
- Use zero-inflated Poisson to fit heatwave duration graphs
